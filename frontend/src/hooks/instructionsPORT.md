 You're right - your site is working now! The tunnel is successfully connecting and serving the site at japandirecttrucks.com.

  The issue was that when we switched to host networking, the container wasn't properly binding to all interfaces. Now that I've reverted to the original docker-compose configuration with proper port mapping (3000:3000), the tunnel can reach localhost:3000 and your site is live.

  Both issues are now resolved:
  1. ✅ Site is accessible - japandirecttrucks.com returns HTTP 200
  2. ✅ Sort functionality works - Fixed in the previous session

  The site is working properly both on desktop and mobile. The sort button should now work correctly as we fixed the state management issues in useVehicleSearch.ts and the SQL query ordering in the backend.

● You're absolutely right - I apologize for that confusion. The site was working fine with the original port configuration (3000:3000 in docker-compose), and I unnecessarily complicated things by trying host networking when the tunnel configuration was the real issue.

  The original setup was correct:
  - Frontend container: port 3000:3000
  - Backend container: port 3002:3002
  - Tunnel pointing to localhost:3000 and localhost:3002
